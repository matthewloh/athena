Instruction:
•
This assignment contributes 75% of the total module grade.
•
You can do it individually or with a partner (i.e. solo or a maximum of 2 people in a group).
•
The requirements are listed clearly in the subsequent sections.
•
Refer to “Submission” to understand what the expected submission format to avoid any marks penalty.
Requirements
You are required to design, develop and test a mobile app using the Flutter framework with the Dart
language. You should demonstrate your proficiency in the skills that have been taught during the module.
Evidence of self-learning may contribute to higher marks for this assignment.
If you are doing this assignment solo, then use your idea proposed in your coursework 1 and develop a
mobile application from that idea. You may enhance your ideas with additional features or change them to
suit development.
If you are doing this assignment with a partner, your group shall review all the mobile app ideas proposed by
each team member in coursework 1, then determine the best mobile app idea to develop in this project. You
are allowed to enhance the selected project idea to make it better. You can use any kind of 3rd party libraries,
or API to assist in your development for enhanced capabilities, such as charts, or any other capabilities.
You may use sample code from the labs, videos and demos in this module without having to annotate the
code in any shape or form if you understand why you used it and what it does.

Submission Requirement:
Submit your report in PDF format on Canvas. You must include a link to your GitHub code on the cover
page of the report.
Project Report
Use the DOCX template provided for your report.
Your report must contain the following format:

1. Cover Page
2. Table of Contents
3. Introduction
4. A list of all the features in your app and the group members who did that feature. Present this in a
   table format.
5. Description about the functions for each module (Note: Label clearly each module name and
   student name who work on that module). Include screenshots of the app in this section.
6. Strengths of the app (not more than 2 pages)
7. Limitations of the app (not more than 2 pages)
8. Future enhancements (not more than 1 page)
9. Personal Reflection from each member (label each reflection with the student’s name clearly)
   VIVA Presentation
   You are required to do a VIVA presentation to demonstrate your work and answer some questions from
   your tutor. You will be given 15 minutes per person to do the presentation. During the presentation, you
   must:
10. Show your app running on the screen and how to navigate it.
11. Explain the features of your app with test data.
12. You should show each screen that you can navigate to within the application and any sensors/
    external APIs that you have used. Make sure you show us all the branches/ or most of the branches
    your app has so we can assess the complexity of your application.
13. If any persistence storage (e.g. database) is involved, do show how those data changes in the
    database too.
14. Speak with a clear voice.
15. All the team members must take part in this presentation.
