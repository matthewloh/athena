# CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

1.1
Problem Statement
In today’s fast-paced educational environment, students face significant academic stress, with
many experiencing mental health issues like anxiety and emotional distress (Fatzunnahar,
2023). According to a study conducted by researchers in Malaysia, 53.9%, 66.2%, and 44.6%
of university students face moderate to severe depression, anxiety, and stress, respectively
(Wong et al., 2023). These alarming statistics highlight a growing crisis in student well-being,
which stems from several persistent issues faced by students in the current education system.
One of the major issues is the overwhelming academic workload that students must
manage. Students face immense pressure to juggle between multiple subjects with continuous
assignments, exams, or coursework, often leading to procrastination or burnout. A study
conducted on academic stress in higher education found that 80% of participants relate stress
to academic workload, with 60% considering exams as a significant source of stress (Perez-
Jorge et al., 2025). Additionally, research by the American Psychological Association (APA)
indicates that approximately 87% of college students in the United States (U.S.) consider
education as a primary stressor, owing to demanding workload, academic competition,
financial issues, and family pressure (Verbanas, 2022).
Another critical issue is the difficulty of searching and accessing accurate and
relevant information. Students frequently use internet search engines such as Google to
look for information required for their homework, assignments, or studies. However, it can be
highly time-consuming and can lead to confusion due to conflicting information. This is
because there are countless sources of information fragmented across the internet. Research
from Stanford University indicates that students often struggle to judge the credibility of online
information, making it challenging to distinguish reliable sources from incorrect ones (Donald,
2016). Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in recent
years and have become mostly accurate, there is currently no seamless way to integrate LLMs
into students’ personalized learning environments as they are typically standalone applications
(Wang et al., 2024).

2
Additionally, students often lack effective review techniques, resulting in poor
knowledge retention. The forgetting curve theory, Ebbinghaus’s Forgetting Curve, is a human
memory theory which demonstrates the rapid decline of memory retention over time without
periodic review. Ebbinghaus emphasized that frequent review ensures less information is
forgotten after each review session. In support of this theory, research has found that humans
forget 50% of new information within an hour, increasing to an estimated 70% within 24 hours
(Gupta, 2024). In today’s demanding study lifestyle, students have to take on significant
amounts of information from several subjects at a time, further decreasing knowledge retention
especially without consistent review.
Figure 1.1:The Forgetting Curve (Gupta, 2024)
Effective time management is another challenge amongst students. Many students
lack the skills to manage and prioritize their tasks, leading to misaligned focus or missed
deadlines. This is particularly difficult for students balancing academic work with
extracurricular activities, part-time jobs, or personal commitments. For instance, a study by
Acuity Training found that 82% of people do not have a proper time management system,
while 25% just deal with any task that seems important at a given time without proper
consideration (Richardson, 2025). Based on a survey by Kahoot, 47% of respondents consider
time management as the biggest challenge in their studies (Kahoot, 2024).
Figure 1.2: Biggest challenges faced by students when studying (Kahoot, 2024)

Finally, emotional support is also lacking in the educational environment of most
students as they are expected to navigate academic challenges independently. Without
appropriate support, academic stress often leads to frustration, anxiety, and depression,
further reducing motivation and academic performance (Fatzunnahar, 2023; Wang et al.,
2024). However, research has shown that integrating social and emotional learning (SEL) into
academic lifestyles can significantly improve mental health and academic performance
(CASEL, 2025). Supporting this claim, a study in Canada found that students who participated
in SEL programs achieved an average of 13% higher academic performance than those who
did not participate (Taylor et al., 2017).
In summary, these interrelated issues clearly highlight the need for a centralized,
intelligent, and emotionally aware solution to academic challenges. The proposed mobile
application will be designed to address these problems by providing study support, adaptive
review, instant access to information, knowledge or notes management, and emotional
support, all within a single personalized platform which acts as an intelligent study companion.
1.2
Objectives
The objectives of the proposed solution are:

1. To develop a mobile application with a chatbot using a LLM that provides instant
   academic support through multimodal input, including answering questions, providing
   explanations, and summarizing notes.
2. To implement an adaptive review system that generates personalized quizzes based
   on the user’s past mistakes, weak areas, and study history using spaced repetition
   techniques like flashcards to enhance knowledge retention.
3. To design an intelligent study planner that dynamically adapts to the user’s schedule
   and emotional state, providing personalized study recommendations and notifications.

2.3.4 Analysis
2.3.4(a) Strengths and Weaknesses
Gauth is excellent for instant question assistance and is particularly useful for short, specific
questions like math problems. It shines in its simplicity and clarity as the interface focuses
entirely on the homework assistant feature, thus reducing clutter and confusion. However, its
major disadvantage is that the AI homework assistant is restricted to photo input only. This
leads to a lack of convenience and customizability over the question being provided to the AI
assistant. Furthermore, the user is not allowed to send follow-up questions to the AI assistant
in a conversational interaction, which means the user would need to physically modify the
original question and resubmit.
Quizlet has a highly comprehensive adaptive review system suitable for practice and
knowledge retention. Its greatest strength is its interactive and gamified study modes including
flashcards and alternative modes which accommodate various learning styles. However, its
downside is the lack of direct question or homework assistance to support the review system.
If a user encounters confusion while reviewing a flashcard set or study guide, they are forced
to seek external help, which disrupts the learning process and reduces convenience.
2.3.4(b)
Key Differences
Athena aims to be a major upgrade to existing applications like Gauth and Quizlet by offering
a complete study companion that combines academic assistance, adaptive review, and study
planning, with emphasis on emotional support. Unlike Gauth, Athena supports multimodal
input for its academic assistant AI chatbot which supports two-way communication, note
summarization, and emotional awareness. Compared to Quizlet, Athena’s review system has
lesser study modes as it focuses more on practicality instead of gamification. Athena’s chatbot
can also assist with review while Quizlet does not have such functionality. Additionally, Athena
adds unique value by including an intelligent study planner along with additional features like
study material management, study buddy matching, and study timer with focus modes. These
key differences and added value come together to make Athena an original all-in-one study
companion application.

CHAPTER 3: CLOUD COMPUTING
3.1
Introduction to Cloud Computing in Mobile Applications
Cloud computing is a technology that allows any system or device to utilize computing
resources in remote servers over the internet. Unlike traditional applications that rely solely on
local resources of a mobile device, mobile applications with cloud integration can access
virtually unlimited computing resources for data storage, processing, and service delivery,
enhancing both performance and user experience (Terekhov, 2023).
3.2
Benefits of Cloud Computing in Enhancing User Experience
Data Storage and Access
Cloud computing enables mobile applications to store data online in cloud servers, reducing
reliance on local device storage and eliminating storage limitations. This is because cloud
computing infrastructure typically have virtually unlimited storage capacity across countless
servers shared by all users. This minimizes the need for users to manage their device storage
to clear up space for data used by mobile applications. Cloud storage also ensures users can
access their data anytime and anywhere provided that they have internet connectivity. For
example, Google Drive is a cloud storage application that allows users to store large volumes
of data on Google’s cloud infrastructure (Terekhov, 2023).
Real-Time Data Synchronization
With cloud computing, users’ data can be synchronized in real-time through the internet. This
ensures that changes made on one device are almost instantly reflected on other devices,
offering up-to-date information to users at all times. For instance, WhatsApp uses cloud
infrastructure to ensure that chat messages are synchronized across devices, providing a
consistent user experience (Singh, 2025).

18
Scalability
Mobile applications with cloud integration can easily scale their resources to accommodate
varying volumes of users without the need for infrastructure or system architecture changes.
This is due to the fact that cloud infrastructure typically consists of server farms with countless
virtual servers that automatically allocate resources for the hosted application based on
demand. This ensures that all users have uninterrupted access to these services with smooth
user experience. In contrast, traditional on-premise server infrastructure is prone to lag and
performance drops in the event of overwhelming traffic (MoldStud, 2024).
Computational Power
Cloud computing allows mobile applications to perform complex tasks without consuming the
computing resources of the user’s device. This is because processing tasks can be offloaded
to cloud servers behind the scenes, while the mobile application simply serves as a frontend
interface for interactivity and displaying results. This is particularly useful for resource-
intensive tasks like image recognition, machine learning, complex calculations, and other
computationally heavy tasks which could strain mobile device resources. For example, Google
Photos uses cloud-based resources to enhance images, organize photo libraries, and perform
object recognition (Vadita, 2023).
Security and Backup
Cloud computing services are often built with advanced security features such as data
encryption, authentication, and automatic backups. Data encryption transforms user
information into an unreadable format, securing it from unauthorized personnel during storage
and transmission. Secure authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication
(MFA) adds additional layers of security to verify user identity and prevent unauthorized
access. In the event of a disaster or security breach, automatic backups enable quick data
recovery, ensuring both data availability and reliability (Terekhov, 2023; Oleg, 2025).

19
3.3
Practical Use of Cloud Computing in Athena
3.3.1 Integration of Cloud Computing in Athena
AI Model Hosting
The AI models used to facilitate features such as Athena’s chatbot assistant and adaptive
review system will be hosted in a cloud server. This enables Athena to perform computationally
complex tasks such as natural language processing and response generation on cloud servers
without consuming the user’s device resources. All users can benefit from fast and accurate
responses from these features even on devices with lower specifications. Therefore, this helps
students save cost by eliminating the need to purchase new devices with improved hardware
just to use Athena.
Data Storage and Access
Athena will securely store all user data such as chatbot conversations, notes, review sets,
study plans, and study progress in cloud servers. A cloud database will be used to store
structured or unstructured data with querying capabilities, while cloud storage will be utilized
to store raw files like images and documents. This approach ensures that user data is safely
stored without occupying the user’s local device storage. Furthermore, data stored on the
cloud can be accessed remotely, which allows students to conduct study sessions anytime
and anywhere based on their schedule and preferred study environment.
Real-Time Data Synchronization
Athena will utilize cloud computing to ensure all user data is automatically synchronized across
the user’s devices. Users can begin a study session on one device and continue on another
device without disruption as any change in data is instantly updated on the cloud. This
eliminates the need for manual transfer of data and ensures an efficient study experience.
Security and Backup
Athena will secure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data through cloud-
based security mechanisms. All user data such as profiles, chatbot conversations, or notes
will be encrypted in transit and at rest. Regular backups will also be scheduled and performed
to guarantee data recovery in the event of infrastructure damage or system failure.
Additionally, users can enable MFA to add an extra layer of security and prevent unauthorized
access to their accounts.

20
3.3.2 Cloud-Integrated System Architecture
The cloud-integrated system architecture of Athena would consist of the client-side Frontend
layer as well as the Backend and Data Storage layers hosted in the cloud. The Frontend
consists of the mobile application which acts as the interface that users interact with to use
the system features. The Backend consists of an Application Programming Interface (API)
that contains code and AI models used to run key features. It completes processes requested
by the client and returns the output to the user. The Data Storage comprises a storage
platform and database server. The storage platform stores raw files such as images and
documents uploaded by users for academic assistance, note management, and more. The
database server stores structured and/or unstructured user data supported with querying
capabilities for data retrieval and manipulation.

CHAPTER 4: EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
4.1
Introduction to AI in Mobile Applications
AI in mobile applications utilize advanced algorithms and techniques that enable applications
to autonomously perform tasks without direct human intervention. There is a plethora of uses
cases of AI in mobile applications, such as understanding natural language, image recognition,
predictions, recommendation systems, and more (Wangoo, 2025). Generally, AI technology
enhances user experience by allowing applications to provide intelligent assistance, automate
routine tasks, interact with users based on pre-established context, and adapt to individual
user preferences for personalized experiences (Jha, 2024). As AI technology continues to
rapidly evolve and become more accessible, AI features will become increasingly sought after
in mobile applications to enhance system functionality and user satisfaction.
4.2
Benefits of AI in Enhancing User Experience
Personalization & Recommendation
AI enhances user experience in mobile applications by facilitating personalized content
delivery and interactivity. AI has the ability to analyse user behaviour and past interactions to
deliver content or recommendations tailored to the user’s preferences. This personalized
experience increases user engagement and satisfaction as users are more likely to interact
with content that matches their interests. For example, Netflix’s recommendation system uses
AI algorithms to suggest movies or shows based on a user’s viewing history and search
behaviour to ensure that users receive content that aligns with their preferences (Apostoliadis,
2025).
Intelligent User Assistance
AI chatbots can enhance user experience by providing instant support without human
intervention. These intelligent chatbots can independently assist users by answering queries,
resolving common issue, and escalating unfamiliar or complex problems to human agents
when necessary. This improves response times while also allowing human agents to focus on
more important tasks (Apostoliadis, 2025; Wangoo, 2025). A notable real-world example of
this is H&M’s AI chatbot for customer support which supports product inquiries, order tracking,
and styling advice. The use of this chatbot significantly increased customer satisfaction by
35% and reduced operational costs by 20% (Shetty, 2024).

22
Enhanced Accessibility
Accessibility in mobile applications can be enhanced by AI through features like voice
recognition, image recognition, and text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities, making applications
more inclusive for a wide range of users, including those with disabilities (Apostoliadis, 2025).
For instance, Google Assistant uses AI voice recognition to detect voice commands from the
user to assist with tasks like phone calls, texting, queries, scheduling, and more. Additionally,
there are applications specifically designed to assist disabled people, such as Be My Eyes
which uses AI image recognition to describe objects and surroundings for visually impaired
users (Be My Eyes, 2023). These AI-enabled accessibility features allow mobile applications
to be more user-friendly and adaptable to varying needs of users.
Enhanced Security
AI is widely applied in mobile cybersecurity to enhance the security of applications through
threat detection, management, and response (Goodman, 2025). A good example of AI-driven
security is real-time fraud detection and prevention in mobile banking applications. By
continuously monitoring user behaviour and transaction patterns, AI algorithms can identify
anomalies that indicate fraudulent activities, thus enhancing security for customers (Sapra,
2024). In addition, Google’s Messages application utilizes AI to detect scam texts by
monitoring Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Message Service (MMS), and Rich
Communication Service (RCS) messages for suspicious patterns, while also providing real-
time warnings to users (Weatherbed, 2025). These AI-powered security measures help protect
users from various threats, thus building trust in the application’s reliability and enhancing
overall user experience.

23
4.3
Practical Use of AI in Existing Applications
4.3.1 Introduction to Duolingo
One of the most well-developed educational mobile applications that effectively apply AI is
Duolingo. With over 500 million downloads an a rating of 4.7 stars, Duolingo is the most
popular language-learning application available on the Google Play Store worldwide
(Duolingo, 2025). Duolingo utilizes AI to provide personalized, adaptive learning experiences
for users, making it a leading example of how AI can be used to enhance mobile application
functionality and user experience.
4.3.2 Integration of AI in Duolingo
Adaptive Learning System
Duolingo uses their own proprietary AI system called Birdbrain, which is used to create
personalized learning experiences for each user (Wallingford, 2024). Through analysis of user
performance data such as accuracy and time spent on exercises, Birdbrain is able to identify
the user’s strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, the difficulty may increase if the user is
consistently getting the answers correct in an exercise. This approach allows Birdbrain to
adjust difficulty of lessons and modify lesson content dynamically to ensure that users can
focus on specific areas of improvement (Wodzak, 2023).
Figure 4.1: Adaptive learning system in Duolingo (Walsh, Lownes and Blanco, 2020)

24
Speech Recognition
To assist users in improving pronunciation, Duolingo incorporates AI speech recognition
technology in learning features. During speaking exercises, the speech recognition system
analyses the user’s speech in real-time and the application provides immediate feedback
based on pronunciation accuracy (Wallingford, 2025). This feature not only aids users in
pronunciation but also indirectly enhances the accessibility of the application for users with
varying learning preferences or disabilities.
Figure 4.2: Speaking exercise with speech recognition in Duolingo (Moline and Blanco, 2020)

25
Verbal Conversation Chatbot
Duolingo comes with an interactive verbal chatbot character named Lily, designed to facilitate
language learning through natural conversational practice in the form of video calls. Lily is
powered by LLMs that generate context-aware dialogue, allowing users to practice real-world
conversations while receiving immediate feedback including corrections, explanations, and
encouragement. The LLMs behind Lily are guided by structured prompts that are used
generate Lily’s responses while maintaining their personality. This helps users learn from their

Roleplay Chatbot
Similar to Lily, Duolingo also provides a Roleplay feature which allows users to engage in
simulated conversations with AI chatbots. However, the key difference is the Roleplay feature
only supports text-based conversations. Roleplay interactions are designed to simulate real-
life scenarios to provide users with practical language practice. This feature is powered by the
GPT-4 LLM which dynamically generates responses based on the user’s input for
personalized experiences. In each interaction, the LLM provides feedback to help users
improve their conversational skills (Duolingo Team, 2023).

Lesson Content Generation
Duolingo also uses LLMs to automatically generate lesson content, saving time and resources.
These LLMs are capable of producing a variety of language exercises such as vocabulary
practice, grammar explanations, and sentence construction tasks. They are guided by prompts
carefully designed by Duolingo’s curriculum experts to ensure generated content aligns with
specific learning objectives and high educational standards (Henry, 2024). This method allows
Duolingo to easily expand its course offerings by introducing new languages and course
contents with minimal manual effort. Users can benefit from an ever-growing collection of
courses and lessons with fresh and diverse contents.
