# Adaptive Review System Feature (`feature/review`)

## 1. Overview

The Adaptive Review System is a core feature of the Athena application designed to enhance learning and knowledge retention through personalized and timely review sessions. It leverages spaced repetition principles and active recall techniques to combat the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve. Users can create quizzes from their study materials, engage in structured review sessions with flashcards and multiple-choice questions, and receive AI-generated questions to optimize their learning experience. The system intelligently schedules reviews based on user performance and proven learning science principles.

## 2. Key Responsibilities

- **Quiz Creation:** Allow users to create quizzes manually or generate them automatically from existing study materials using AI.
- **Quiz Management:** Provide detailed quiz views with metadata, performance analytics, and session history for comprehensive quiz oversight.
- **Spaced Repetition Algorithm:** Implement intelligent scheduling of review items based on user performance and spaced repetition principles (SM-2 algorithm).
- **Review Sessions:** Provide interactive review sessions with flashcards and multiple-choice questions.
- **Performance Tracking:** Monitor user progress, self-assessment, and learning analytics with detailed historical analysis.
- **AI Integration:** Interface with backend LLM (via Supabase Edge Function) to generate relevant questions from study materials.
- **Data Persistence:** Store quiz data, review history, and spaced repetition metadata for long-term learning tracking.

  - Other providers manage dependencies for use cases, repositories, and data sources.
  - State includes quiz lists, current review session, due items, and user progress metrics.

## 5. Spaced Repetition Algorithm

The system implements a simplified version of the SM-2 (SuperMemo 2) algorithm:

- **Key Metrics per Item:**
  - `easiness_factor` (EF): Determines how easy an item is to remember (default: 2.5)
  - `interval_days`: Days until next review
  - `repetitions`: Number of successful consecutive reviews
  - `next_review_date`: Calculated next review date

- **Algorithm Logic:**
  - **Rating < 3 (Forgot/Hard):** Reset interval to 1 day, reset repetitions to 0
  - **Rating ≥ 3 (Good/Easy):**
    - Increment repetitions
    - Calculate new interval:
      - Repetition 1: 1 day
      - Repetition 2: 6 days
      - Repetition > 2: previous_interval × EF
    - Update EF: `new_EF = old_EF - 0.8 + 0.28×quality - 0.02×quality²` (minimum EF: 1.3)

## 6. AI Integration
