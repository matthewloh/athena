# Athena CW2: Feature List & Prioritization

This document outlines the planned features for the Athena mobile application for Coursework 2. We will prioritize features based on the CW2 rubric, technical feasibility, and core value proposition.

## Feature Prioritization Key

- **P1 (Must-Have):** Critical for MVP, directly addresses core rubric requirements (complexity, data persistence/API).
- **P2 (Should-Have):** Important for a good user experience and demonstrating broader functionality.
- **P3 (Could-Have):** Nice-to-have, potential stretch goals or future enhancements.

## Discussion Points for Scoping (Re-confirming based on Supabase stack)

- **MVP (P1 Features):** User Authentication, AI Chatbot (text, summarization), Adaptive Review System (flashcards, basic spaced repetition, local/cloud sync). These three provide >3 complex features and screens.
- **Complexity Balance:** The P1 features above should provide high complexity. P2s like Planner, Basic Material Mgt, and Dashboard add breadth.
- **API/Sensor Strategy:**
  1. **LLM via Supabase Edge Function (Vercel AI SDK):** This is API 1 (Excellent).
  2. **Second API:**
     - **OCR for Image-to-Text (Multimodal Input - Feature 9):** Strong candidate. Involves an external API call (either on-device ML Kit or cloud OCR).
     - **External Calendar Integration (Feature 10):** Another strong candidate if it involves a proper API like Google Calendar API, not just a simple intent.
     - `flutter_local_notifications` (for Study Planner) is useful but might be seen as a device capability rather than a distinct external API for "Excellent" marking. It's good to have, but one of the above would be more robust for the rubric.
- **Data Persistence:**
  - **Local:** Hive (or SQFlite) for offline access for Adaptive Review, Planner.
  - **Cloud:** Supabase (PostgreSQL DB with pgvector, Auth, Storage) for user accounts, sync, AI data. This clearly hits "local or cloud persistence services with authorization (RLS)."
- **Simplifications:** Multimodal beyond Photo-to-Text, deep emotional awareness in chatbot, fully dynamic study planner, and study buddy matching are good candidates for "Future Enhancements."

This table should give us a very clear path forward. We can adjust priorities as we delve deeper into implementation realities.
The "Student Responsible" column is ready for you and Thor to fill in.
