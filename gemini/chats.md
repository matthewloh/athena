# Athena Project Chat History Overview

hi i have submitted the first assignment now thanks to your help, I would now like to receive your help in preparing a solid strong prompt to bring over this good work over to my next part of my mobile application development assignment, I want to attach the file that describes the assignment, I want you to write a really good all inclusive prompt with a lot of analogies to the work that is going to be necessary to start off the next conversation fundamentally robustly. I am going to be working in a group with somebody else's project idea. I have attached it in addition to the coursework 2 assignment brief. let's do this

Okay, congratulations on submitting your CW1! It's great that you're already thinking ahead and want to build a strong foundation for CW2.

I've reviewed the documents:

    6002CEM_CW2_APRIL2025.pdf: This is your Coursework 2 (CW2) brief. It's a group project (max 2 people) worth 75% of your module mark. The core task is to design, develop, and test a mobile app using Flutter and Dart. You'll be using one of the group members' CW1 ideas, potentially enhancing it. There's a report (using a DOCX template) and a VIVA presentation required. Key aspects include application complexity, data persistence/API integration, UI design, and comprehensive documentation of features and individual contributions.
    ThorWenZheng_6002CEM_CW1_Report.pdf: This is the CW1 report for the "Athena" app idea – an AI study companion. It details features like an AI chatbot for academic assistance, an adaptive review system, and an intelligent study planner, with a strong emphasis on AI and cloud integration. This is the project idea your group will be working with for CW2.

You're looking for a robust prompt to kick off the CW2 work, especially to have a fruitful conversation with your project partner, building on the "Athena" concept. The goal is to transition the CW1 "Athena" idea into a practical, implementable CW2 project, keeping the new marking rubric and group dynamics in mind.

Here's a comprehensive prompt you can use to start discussions with your partner and to guide your initial CW2 planning. This prompt uses analogies to emphasize the different stages and considerations for transforming the "Athena" CW1 concept into a successful CW2 project.

"Project Athena - CW2 Liftoff: From Blueprint to Prototype & Beyond"

"Team, we've successfully architected the 'blueprint' for Athena in CW1 – a powerful vision for an AI Study Companion. Now, for CW2, our mission is to transform this blueprint into a tangible, working 'prototype' and eventually a 'show-worthy model home.' This isn't just about coding; it's about strategic construction, teamwork, and demonstrating mastery of mobile app development.

Our Starting Point: The 'Athena' CW1 Blueprint (Thor Wen Zheng's Report)

    The Vision: An AI study companion enhancing learning via personalized academic support, adaptive review, and intelligent study planning, with key modules like an AI Chatbot (multimodal input, emotional awareness), Adaptive Review System (personalized quizzes, spaced repetition), and Intelligent Study Planner (dynamic scheduling, mood adaptation).
    Core Technologies Envisioned: AI (LLMs for chatbot, ML for personalization), Cloud Computing (AI model hosting, data storage, sync, security).

The CW2 Challenge: Building the 'Athena' Prototype (and beyond)

Think of CW2 as a multi-stage construction project:

    Revisiting the Blueprint & Site Survey (Project Scoping & Feature Prioritization):
        Analogy: Before laying the foundation, even the best blueprint needs a review against the actual building site (our time, skills, CW2 requirements) and budget (complexity we can achieve).
        Key Questions for Us:
            Given the CW1 "Athena" idea (Thor Wen Zheng's project), which features are the absolute cornerstones for an impressive CW2 prototype? (Refer to CW2 rubric: app complexity, features, data persistence/API).
            What's our "Minimum Viable Product" (MVP) that showcases the core 'Athena' magic, and what are "stretch goals" or "Phase 2 renovations"?
            How can we smartly "phase construction" to ensure we have a functional, demonstrable app with key AI/cloud elements, even if not all CW1 features are fully built out?
            Are there any features from the original "Athena" idea that might be too ambitious for the CW2 timeframe or Flutter/Dart implementation by a two-person team? Can we simplify or adapt them without losing the core value? (e.g., full multimodal input might simplify to text/image initially).
            How will we divide the 'construction efforts' (features, modules) clearly between us to ensure both individual contribution and a cohesive final product? (CW2 report requires this).

    Gathering Our Tools & Materials (Tech Stack & Learning):
        Analogy: Every construction crew needs the right tools (Flutter, Dart, specific APIs, cloud services) and skilled workers.
        Key Questions for Us:
            Confirming Flutter & Dart as our primary tools. What specific 3rd party libraries or APIs (as allowed in CW2 brief) will be our 'power tools' for things like:
                AI Chatbot interface? (Interfacing with an LLM API like OpenAI, Cohere, or a local model if feasible)
                Data persistence? (Firebase, SQLite, other cloud DBs)
                User Authentication?
                Specific UI elements or animations?
            What 'self-learning' (mentioned in CW2 brief for higher marks) might be needed for specific advanced features we choose? How do we plan for this?

    Laying the Foundation & Framing (Core Architecture & UI/UX Design):
        Analogy: A strong foundation and well-thought-out frame are essential before the fancy fixtures go in.
        Key Questions for Us:
            What will be the core app architecture? How will modules (Chatbot, Review System, Planner) interact?
            What does the user journey look like for the prioritized features? Let's sketch out key screens and navigation flows.
            How do we ensure a 'Good' to 'Excellent' UI Design (as per CW2 rubric) – user-friendly, intuitive, with a suitable color palette, and appropriate for "Athena's" purpose as a study companion?
            What security policies (LO3) do we need for confidential data (e.g., user study progress, notes)?

    Building the Walls & Installing Systems (Feature Development & Integration):
        Analogy: This is where the app takes shape – coding the features, connecting the plumbing (APIs) and electricals (data flows).
        Key Questions for Us:
            How will we implement data persistence (local/cloud) for user data, notes, quiz progress, etc.? (CW2 rubric emphasizes this).
            How will we integrate external APIs (e.g., for AI models, cloud storage)?
            How do we ensure ease of data access/usability across platforms (LO4), even if primarily targeting mobile? (e.g., data sync if a web component were a future thought).
            What's our testing strategy throughout development?

    Interior Design & Finishing Touches (Refinement & Polishing):
        Analogy: Making the 'model home' presentable and impressive.
        Key Questions for Us:
            Focus on UI polish, smooth navigation, and handling edge cases.
            Preparing test data to clearly demonstrate all features during the VIVA.

    The 'Home Inspection' & 'Open House' (Report & VIVA Prep):
        Analogy: Documenting our build (report) and showcasing our masterpiece (VIVA).
        Key Questions for Us:
            How will we meticulously document who did what for each feature/module in the report? (Table format required).
            What screenshots will best showcase our app's functionality and design?
            How do we prepare for a smooth, confident VIVA, ensuring both members can explain their contributions and the overall app? (15 mins per person).

Our Immediate Next Steps:

    Deep Dive into CW1 'Athena': Both thoroughly re-read Thor Wen Zheng's CW1 report to ensure a shared, deep understanding of the original vision, features, and rationale.
    Feature Prioritization Workshop: Based on the CW2 rubric (complexity, functionalities, persistence/API, UI), let's list all 'Athena' features and collaboratively decide:
        'Must-Haves' for CW2: Core features that are essential to demonstrate the app's concept and meet rubric requirements for a good/excellent grade.
        'Should-Haves': Important features that add significant value if time permits.
        'Could-Haves'/'Won't Haves (for CW2)': Features that are lower priority or too complex for this phase, potentially noted as 'future enhancements.'
    Initial Task Allocation: Tentatively assign primary responsibility for the 'Must-Have' features/modules.

The goal of this initial discussion isn't to solve everything, but to establish a shared understanding of how we'll translate the 'Athena' idea into a successful CW2 project, using the CW2 brief and rubric as our guiding construction code. Let's ensure our 'Athena' prototype is not just functional but truly showcases innovation and robust development!"

Why this prompt is designed to be effective:

    All-Inclusive: It directly references both provided documents (CW2 brief and the specific CW1 "Athena" report).
    Analogies: Uses the "blueprint to prototype/model home" and "construction project" analogy to make the complex process of app development more relatable and to structure the thinking process.
    Fundamentally Robust Start:
        It immediately grounds the discussion in the chosen CW1 idea ("Athena").
        It forces a review of CW2 requirements and the marking rubric from the outset.
        It emphasizes strategic feature prioritization (MVP thinking) which is crucial for a time-bound project.
        It prompts early discussion on division of labor, which is key for group work.
        It covers technical considerations (tech stack, architecture, data persistence, APIs, security) and non-technical aspects (UI/UX, report, VIVA).
    Action-Oriented: It ends with clear "Immediate Next Steps."
    Addresses Group Work: Specifically asks about dividing efforts and ensuring both members contribute.
    Forward-Looking: Encourages thinking about "stretch goals" and "future enhancements," which is good for the report.

This prompt should provide a very solid and structured starting point for your conversation with your partner, ensuring you're both aligned and addressing all critical aspects of CW2 right from the beginning. Good luck with CW2!

    Paste it as your very first message in the new chat.
    Replace "[Your Name]" with your actual name.

This will provide a comprehensive foundation for all subsequent interactions in that chat, ensuring the AI has all the necessary background to assist you effectively with CW2 for Project Athena.

Great, i want to discuss with you how were going to implement the LLM integration with supabase's flutter/dart sdk. I want you to think of the whole supabase architecture when it comes to the features of the application. Tell me how to proceed with the whole process in clear well detailed steps as if you were a principal mobile application developer to aim for 70+ marks for this assignment. I will have to include design charts to help explain the complex flows and sequences too. So let's keep this in mind as we move on with the next steps.

Okay, this is exactly where the architectural planning becomes crucial for hitting those high marks in CW2. Integrating an LLM with Supabase for your "Athena" app is a smart choice, as Supabase can handle a lot of the backend heavy lifting, allowing you to focus on the Flutter frontend and the core AI logic.

Let's approach this as a principal mobile application developer would, outlining a clear, detailed strategy to implement the LLM integration and overall Supabase architecture for "Athena," keeping your 70+ marks goal and the need for design charts in mind.

Principal Developer's Strategy: Building "Athena" with Flutter, Supabase, & LLM Integration

Our overarching goal is to build a robust, scalable, and feature-rich "Athena" app that impresses in terms of complexity, functionality, UI/UX, and technical implementation, as per your CW2 rubric. Supabase will be our Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS), and we'll integrate an external LLM API (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, or another of your choice).

Here’s a step-by-step process:

Phase 1: Foundation & Supabase Backend Setup (The "Mission Control" Analogy)

Think of Supabase as your mission control center. It needs to be set up correctly before your "Athena" rocket (the Flutter app) can launch and operate effectively.

    Step 1: Project Initialization & Supabase Setup
        Action: Create your Flutter project. Create a new project in Supabase.
        Details: Install the supabase_flutter package in your Flutter project. Initialize Supabase in your main.dart file with your project URL and anon key.
        Rubric Relevance: Establishes the core technical environment.

    Step 2: Authentication (Securing "Athena's" User Access - LO3)
        Action: Implement user registration (email/password) and login using Supabase Auth.
        Details: Design UI screens for sign-up, login, and potentially password reset. Use supabase.auth.signUp(), supabase.auth.signInWithPassword(), and supabase.auth.signOut(). Implement session management to keep users logged in.
        Supabase Architecture: Leverages Supabase's built-in Auth service, which handles user tables, secure password storage, and JWT (JSON Web Token) management.
        Rubric Relevance: "Local or cloud persistence services with authorization" – this is fundamental. Addresses LO3 (Security Policy).
        Design Chart Idea: User Authentication Flow (Sign-up, Login, Session Management, Logout).

    Step 3: Database Design & Setup (The "Athena" Knowledge Core)
        Action: Design your PostgreSQL database schema within Supabase.
        Details: Create tables for:
            users: (Handled by Supabase Auth, but you might extend it with a profiles table linked via user ID for app-specific user data like preferred subjects, learning goals, emotional state indicators).
            study_materials: To store metadata about user-uploaded notes (e.g., material_id, user_id, title, subject, storage_path, summary, created_at).
            chat_history: To store conversations with the AI chatbot (chat_id, user_id, session_id, message_content, sender ('user' or 'ai'), timestamp).
            quizzes: For the adaptive review system (quiz_id, user_id, material_id (if based on specific notes), title, created_at).
            quiz_questions: (question_id, quiz_id, question_text, answer_text, question_type (e.g., flashcard, MCQ)).
            quiz_attempts: To track user performance (attempt_id, user_id, quiz_id, question_id, user_answer, is_correct, attempted_at, next_review_date for spaced repetition).
            study_plans: (plan_id, user_id, title, start_date, end_date).
            study_sessions: (session_id, plan_id, user_id, subject, goal, scheduled_time, duration, status (e.g., pending, completed, missed), mood_before, mood_after).
        Supabase Architecture: Utilizes Supabase Database (PostgreSQL). Define Row Level Security (RLS) policies on these tables to ensure users can only access and modify their own data. This is critical for LO3.
        Rubric Relevance: "Cloud persistence services with authorization." Well-structured tables demonstrate complexity.
        Design Chart Idea: Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the Supabase Database.

    Step 4: Storage Setup (Storing "Athena's" Raw Materials)
        Action: Configure Supabase Storage for handling file uploads.
        Details: Create buckets (e.g., study_notes_uploads). Define storage policies to restrict access so users can only upload to their own designated paths and access their own files. This will be used for the "Note Summarization" feature where users upload notes.
        Supabase Architecture: Utilizes Supabase Storage.
        Rubric Relevance: Demonstrates use of cloud services for practical features.
        Design Chart Idea: Data Flow for Note Upload & Summarization (including storage interaction).

Phase 2: Core Feature Implementation with LLM & Supabase (Building "Athena's" Intelligence)

Now, we start building the core modules, integrating the LLM via Supabase Edge Functions for security and scalability.

    Step 5: AI Chatbot – LLM Integration via Supabase Edge Functions (The "Athena" Oracle)
        Action: Develop the AI Chatbot feature.
        Flutter UI:
            Create a chat interface (message bubbles, input field).
            When a user sends a message, display it immediately.
            Show a loading indicator while waiting for the AI response.
        Supabase Edge Function (Dart or TypeScript):
            Purpose: This function will act as a secure intermediary between your Flutter app and the external LLM API (e.g., OpenAI API). Never expose your LLM API key directly in the Flutter app.
            Input: User's message, potentially conversation history for context, user ID (from Supabase Auth context within the function).
            Logic:
                Receive the request from the Flutter app.
                Securely retrieve the LLM API key (stored as a secret in Supabase Edge Function settings).
                Construct the prompt for the LLM. For basic chat, this is the user's message. For RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) in later stages:
                    Query your Supabase study_materials table (or a dedicated vector store if you implement one later) for relevant notes based on the user's query.
                    Combine retrieved notes with the user's query to form a richer prompt.
                Make an HTTPS request to the LLM API.
                Receive the LLM's response.
                (Optional) Process/filter the response.
                Return the AI's response to the Flutter app.
            Authentication: Ensure your Edge Function can only be called by authenticated users (Supabase handles this well).
        Flutter Logic:
            Call the Supabase Edge Function using supabase.functions.invoke('your-chatbot-function', body: {'message': userMessage, 'history': chatHistory}).
            Receive the AI's response and display it.
            Store both user and AI messages in the chat_history table in Supabase Database.
        Supabase Architecture: Flutter App -> Supabase Edge Function -> External LLM API -> Supabase Edge Function -> Flutter App. Chat history stored in Supabase Database.
        Rubric Relevance: "Use of more than one external API intensively" (LLM is one). "Cloud persistence services with authorization" (chat history). High complexity.
        Design Chart Idea: Sequence Diagram for AI Chatbot Interaction (Flutter App, Supabase Auth, Supabase Edge Function, LLM API, Supabase Database).

    Step 6: Study Material Management & Note Summarization (Feeding "Athena")
        Action: Allow users to upload notes (text, images, PDFs - simplify to text/image initially for CW2 scope) and get summaries.
        Flutter UI:
            Interface to upload files or input text.
            Display list of uploaded materials.
        Flutter Logic & Supabase Integration:
            For file uploads: Use supabase.storage.from('study_notes_uploads').upload(). Store the returned path in your study_materials table along with user_id and other metadata.
            For summarization:
                Retrieve the note content (either directly text or OCR'd text from an image – OCR could be another API or a Flutter package).
                Send this content to a Supabase Edge Function (similar to the chatbot one, but with a prompt engineered for summarization).
                The Edge Function calls the LLM API with a summarization prompt.
                Store the summary in the study_materials table.
        Supabase Architecture: Flutter App -> Supabase Storage (for files) / Supabase Database (for text notes & metadata) -> Supabase Edge Function -> LLM API (for summarization) -> Supabase Edge Function -> Supabase Database (to store summary).
        Rubric Relevance: Cloud persistence, API integration, complexity.
        Design Chart Idea: Data Flow for Note Summarization.

    Step 7: Adaptive Review System (Training with "Athena")
        Action: Implement quiz generation and spaced repetition.
        Flutter UI:
            Interface to select material for review or start a general review.
            Flashcard UI / Quiz question display.
            Input for answers.
            Feedback on correctness.
            Progress tracking display.
        Logic & Supabase Integration:
            Quiz Generation:
                Option A (Simpler): User manually creates flashcards/questions stored in quizzes and quiz_questions.
                Option B (More Advanced - LLM based): Allow users to select an uploaded study_material. Send its content/summary to an Edge Function that prompts the LLM to generate relevant questions (e.g., "Generate 5 flashcard questions and answers based on this text: ..."). Store these in quizzes and quiz_questions. This is a strong use of the LLM API.
            Taking a Quiz: Fetch questions from Supabase DB. Store user attempts in quiz_attempts.
            Spaced Repetition: Implement a basic algorithm (e.g., based on Leitner system or a simplified SM-2). When a user answers a question, update next_review_date in quiz_attempts. The app can then query for questions due for review.
        Supabase Architecture: Flutter App <-> Supabase Database (for all quiz data, attempts, review schedules). Optional: Supabase Edge Function -> LLM API (for question generation).
        Rubric Relevance: High complexity, cloud persistence, potential intensive API use if LLM generates questions.
        Design Chart Idea: State Diagram for Spaced Repetition Logic; Data Flow for Quiz Generation & Attempt.

    Step 8: Intelligent Study Planner (Scheduling with "Athena")
        Action: Allow users to create study plans and schedule sessions.
        Flutter UI: Calendar view, forms to create/edit study goals and sessions. Notifications.
        Logic & Supabase Integration:
            CRUD operations for study_plans and study_sessions in Supabase Database.
            Implement local notifications in Flutter to remind users of scheduled sessions.
            "Intelligent" aspect (CW2 scope): Could be simpler for now. E.g., suggest breaking down a large goal from study_plans into smaller study_sessions. Or, based on quiz_attempts, suggest focusing a study session on weaker topics. True dynamic adaptation based on emotional state might be a "future enhancement" unless you find a simple way (e.g., user self-reports mood).
        Supabase Architecture: Flutter App <-> Supabase Database (for planner data).
        Rubric Relevance: Cloud persistence, complexity.
        Design Chart Idea: User Flow for Creating and Managing a Study Plan.

Phase 3: Polish, Testing, & Documentation (The "Final Inspection & Showcase")

    Step 9: UI/UX Refinement
        Action: Ensure the app is user-friendly, visually appealing, and meets the "Good" to "Excellent" UI design criteria.
        Details: Consistent design language, clear navigation, appropriate color palettes, smooth animations. Gather feedback if possible.

    Step 10: Comprehensive Testing
        Action: Test all features thoroughly.
        Details: Unit tests, widget tests, integration tests. Test on different devices/emulators. Test edge cases and error handling. Ensure data persistence and API integrations work reliably.

    Step 11: Report Writing & VIVA Preparation
        Action: Meticulously document your work as per the CW2 report template.
        Details: Clearly describe each module and who implemented it. Include those design charts! Explain your Supabase architecture, LLM integration, security measures (RLS, API key management in Edge Functions). Prepare a compelling VIVA demo.

Key Considerations for 70+ Marks:

    Complexity & Functionality: Implement a good range of interconnected features. The AI chatbot, adaptive review (especially if LLM-generated questions), and study planner, all backed by Supabase, offer high complexity.
    Data Persistence & API Integration: Supabase for persistence WITH Row Level Security for authorization is key. The LLM API is one major external API. Consider if a second distinct API (e.g., for advanced OCR if you do image-based notes, or a specialized educational content API if relevant, or even a simple weather API if you tie it to study planner mood suggestions) can be intensively and meaningfully used. "Intensively" means it's core to a feature, not just a minor add-on.
    Security (LO3): Emphasize RLS in Supabase, secure handling of API keys using Edge Functions, and overall data privacy considerations in your report.
    Self-Learning: Using Supabase Edge Functions, integrating an LLM, and potentially advanced Flutter state management or animation techniques will demonstrate self-learning.
    Clear Documentation & VIVA: Your report and VIVA must clearly articulate your design choices, architecture (this is where your charts will shine), individual contributions, and a deep understanding of the technologies used.

This detailed plan provides a roadmap. The next step is for you and your partner to discuss and refine the exact scope of "Athena" for CW2, prioritizing features that maximize your learning and your marks according to the rubric, while being achievable in the given timeframe. Good luck!

Now let's go really in depth with each of the key features and let's mock up some designs maybe use case diagrams related materials in the system context. I want you to establish a strong foundation for each of the screens and give life to the imagined application. The devil is in the details so leave no stone unturned in your path

Okay, let's dive deep into each key feature of "Athena," bringing it to life with detailed considerations for UI/UX, system architecture using Supabase and Flutter, LLM integration, and relevant design chart suggestions. We're aiming for that 70+ mark territory, so attention to detail and a clear vision for implementation are paramount.

I'll present this as a multi-part response, focusing on one major feature area at a time to ensure thoroughness.

Athena: Feature Deep Dive - Part 1 @gemini/feature_deep_dives/part_1.md
May 17, 1:54 AM

Alright, that looks fantastic, let's move on to the next parts. Before that, can you list out the parts in its entirety for me to understand the whole project

Okay, absolutely. It's wise to have a bird's-eye view of the entire "Athena" project as we envision it for CW2, especially before we get into the granular details of each subsequent feature. This helps in understanding how all the pieces fit together.

Based on Thor Wen Zheng's CW1 "Athena" concept and our initial discussions for CW2 implementation with Flutter and Supabase, here's a breakdown of the major parts or core feature areas of the application:

    User Authentication & Profile Management:
        Secure user sign-up, login, logout, and password reset.
        User profile creation and management (e.g., name, preferred subjects for personalization).
        Supabase Focus: Supabase Auth, profiles table with RLS.

    AI Chatbot (Academic Assistance & LLM Integration):
        Conversational interface for users to ask academic questions, get explanations, and receive guidance.
        Integration with an external LLM (e.g., OpenAI) via Supabase Edge Functions for secure API calls.
        Contextual responses, potentially incorporating user's study materials or profile preferences.
        Storage of chat history.
        (CW1 Vision: Multimodal input, emotionally aware responses - scope to be defined for CW2).
        Supabase Focus: Edge Functions for LLM calls, chat_history table.

    Study Material Management & Note Summarization:
        Allow users to upload/input study notes (text, potentially images/PDFs for CW2 scope).
        Organize and manage these materials.
        AI-powered summarization of uploaded notes using an LLM (via Edge Functions).
        Supabase Focus: Supabase Storage for file uploads, study_materials table for metadata and summaries, Edge Functions for summarization.

    Adaptive Review System (Quizzes & Spaced Repetition):
        Generation of personalized quizzes (e.g., flashcards, MCQs) based on user's study materials or selected topics.
        Quiz generation can be manual (user creates questions) or AI-assisted (LLM generates questions from notes).
        Implementation of spaced repetition algorithms to schedule reviews for optimal knowledge retention.
        Tracking of user performance and progress in reviews.
        Supabase Focus: quizzes, quiz_questions, quiz_attempts tables; Edge Functions if LLM generates questions.

    Intelligent Study Planner:
        Allow users to set study goals and schedule study sessions.
        Dynamic adaptation of study plans (basic for CW2, e.g., based on upcoming deadlines or suggesting topics from weak areas identified in quizzes).
        Reminders and notifications for study sessions.
        (CW1 Vision: Adaptation to emotional state - scope to be defined for CW2).
        Supabase Focus: study_plans, study_sessions tables.

    User Dashboard & Progress Tracking (Consolidated View):
        A central screen to provide users with an overview of their study progress, upcoming sessions, recent quiz performance, and achievements.
        Visual representation of data (e.g., charts for study time, quiz scores).
        Supabase Focus: Aggregating data from various tables (quiz_attempts, study_sessions, etc.).

    (Optional/Stretch Goals for CW2, depending on time and complexity targets):
        Study Timer with Focus Modes (e.g., Pomodoro): A utility integrated within the app.
        Progress Badges and Achievements: Gamification elements to motivate users.
        Study Buddy Matching: A social feature to connect users studying similar topics (this would add significant complexity).

When we go through each of these "parts" in detail, like we did for Authentication, we'll define the specific screens, user flows, Flutter implementation strategies, Supabase interactions, and potential design charts for each.

This list should give you a clear map of the "Athena" application's envisioned structure for CW2. Shall we proceed with the deep dive into the AI Chatbot next?

Alright, seems like you have a very strong grasp on the vision. I align with these so far. Let's continue onwards with Part 2 then.

Okay, excellent! We've laid a solid foundation with User Authentication. Now, let's move to the heart of "Athena's" intelligence: the AI Chatbot. This feature is critical for academic assistance and will heavily involve LLM integration via Supabase.

I'll structure this as Part 2 of our deep dive.
